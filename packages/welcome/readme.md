# **`welcome`**

This is a separate welcome app. It gives you a nice introduction wizard when first visiting the Yoast app.

## Development setup

After cloning this repository and a `yarn install` you can run it in development mode with `yarn start` in this folder.
This allows you to view a compiled version in the browser. It rebuilds automatically when files change, but you have to manually refresh your browser.

```sh
yarn install && yarn start
```
